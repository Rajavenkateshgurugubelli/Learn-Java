# Module 10: Capstone Projects

Apply everything you've learned in these real-world scenarios.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Combine multiple concepts (OOP, Collections, I/O, Concurrency).
- Build functional applications.
- Practice structuring larger codebases.

## 📂 Projects

### 1. Console Banking App
**Concepts:** OOP, Collections, Exceptions.
**Description:** A system to create accounts, deposit/withdraw funds, and transfer money between accounts. Data is stored in memory.

### 2. File-Based Task Manager
**Concepts:** File I/O, Strings, Lists.
**Description:** A CLI tool to add, view, and delete tasks. Tasks are saved to a CSV file so they persist after the program exits.

### 3. Chat Server
**Concepts:** Networking, Concurrency, I/O.
**Description:** A simple TCP server that can handle multiple clients simultaneously using threads. Clients can send messages that are broadcast to others.

## 🚀 How to Run
Each project has its own `Main` class.
1. Navigate to the project folder (e.g., `banking`).
2. Compile and run:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   java Main
   ```
