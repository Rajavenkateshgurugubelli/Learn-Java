# Module 01: Fundamentals

Welcome to the first module of your Java mastery journey! In this module, we will cover the foundational building blocks of the Java programming language.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand the structure of a Java program.
- Learn about variables and data types.
- Master operators for arithmetic and logic.
- Control the flow of your program with loops and conditionals.
- Define reusable blocks of code using methods.
- Store collections of data using arrays.

## 📂 Content Overview

| File | Description |
|Args|---|
| `HelloWorld.java` | Your first Java program! Explains the `main` method and output. |
| `VariablesAndTypes.java` | Difference between primitives and reference types. |
| `Operators.java` | Math, comparison, and logical operations. |
| `ControlFlow.java` | Making decisions with `if`, `switch`, and looping with `for`, `while`. |
| `Methods.java` | Creating modular code with functions. |
| `ArraysBasic.java` | Introduction to fixed-size data structures. |

## 🚀 How to Run
To compile and run any file in this directory:

1.  Open your terminal in this directory.
2.  Compile the file using `javac`:
    ```bash
    javac <FileName>.java
    ```
3.  Run the compiled class:
    ```bash
    java <FileName>
    ```

*Note: Since Java 11, you can also run single-file source code directly without compiling:*
```bash
java <FileName>.java
```
