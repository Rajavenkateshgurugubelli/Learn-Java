# Java Mastery Path

Welcome to your self-paced journey to mastering Java! This repository contains a structured curriculum ranging from absolute basics to advanced concepts and real-world projects.

## � Mission & Purpose

**"Master Java, One Concept at a Time."**

The goal of `java-mastery-path` is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. Whether you are a complete beginner or an experienced developer looking to refresh your skills with modern Java features, this repository provides clear, well-commented examples and hands-on exercises.

### Why this Repository?
Learning programming can often feel disjointed—tutorials cover syntax but miss the "why" and "how" of building real software. We created this repository to:
1.  **Demystify Complex Topics**: Break down hard concepts like Multithreading and Generics into digestible examples.
2.  **Focus on Best Practices**: Teach clean code, proper naming conventions, and modern Java (21+) features from day one.
3.  **Encourage Active Learning**: Every module includes exercises and capstone projects to reinforce learning through doing.

## 🚀 How to Run

You can run individual files directly using the terminal.

**Example:**
To run the `HelloWorld` example from Module 01:

```bash
cd 01-fundamentals
java HelloWorld.java
```

For the Capstone Projects, you may need to compile multiple files:

```bash
cd 10-capstone-projects/banking
javac BankingApp.java
java capstone.banking.BankingApp
```
