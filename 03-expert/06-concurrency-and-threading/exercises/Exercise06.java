/**
 * Module 06: Exercise
 * 
 * Challenge: Race Condition Fixer
 * 
 * 1. Create a SharedResource class with an integer 'counter' = 0.
 * 2. Create a method 'increment()' that increases counter by 1.
 * 3. Create two threads that both call increment() 10,000 times.
 * 4. Run them and print the final result.
 * 5. Observe that the result is likely not 20,000.
 * 6. Fix it using 'synchronized' or AtomicInteger.
