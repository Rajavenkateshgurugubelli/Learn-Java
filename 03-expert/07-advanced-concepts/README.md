# Module 07: Advanced Concepts

Deep dive into the mechanics of the Java language.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Write flexible code using **Generics**.
- Inspect classes and methods at runtime using the **Reflection API**.
- Create and process custom **Annotations**.
- Understand memory management and **Garbage Collection**.

## 📂 Content Overview

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `Generics.java` | Creating generic classes and methods. Wildcards. |
| `ReflectionAPI.java` | Loading classes dynamically and invoking methods. |
| `Annotations.java` | Creating markers like `@Override` or `@Test`. |
| `GarbageCollection.java` | Documentation on Heap, Stack, and GC algorithms. |

## 🚀 Key Concepts
- **Type Erasure**: Generics are a compile-time feature; types are removed at runtime.
- **Reflection**: Powerful, but can break encapsulation and slow down performance.
- **Garbage Collection (GC)**: Automatic memory management. No `malloc()` or `free()` needed!
