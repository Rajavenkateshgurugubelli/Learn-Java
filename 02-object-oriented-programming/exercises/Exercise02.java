 * 
 * 1. Create a class `Book` with private fields: title, author, isBorrowed.
 * 2. Add a constructor and getters.
 * 3. Add methods `borrowBook()` and `returnBook()`.
 * - `borrowBook()` should check if it's already borrowed.
 * - `returnBook()` should mark it as available.
 * 4. Create a main method to create a Book object and test borrowing/returning.
