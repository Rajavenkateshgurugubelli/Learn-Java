# Module 02: Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

In this module, we dive into the core paradigm of Java: Object-Oriented Programming. You will learn how to model real-world concepts using Classes and Objects.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Define Classes and create Objects.
- Understand the four pillars of OOP: **Encapsulation**, **Inheritance**, **Polymorphism**, and **Abstraction**.
- Use the `this` and `super` keywords.
- Manage access with modifiers (`private`, `public`, `protected`).
- Explore Java Records for immutable data.

## 📂 Content Overview

| Folder | Concept |
|---|---|
| `ClassesAndObjects/` | The blueprint (Class) and the instance (Object). Constructors. |
| `Encapsulation/` | Hiding data and exposing it via methods (Getters/Setters). |
| `Inheritance/` | Creating new classes from existing ones (`extends`). |
| `Polymorphism/` | Overloading vs Overriding. Runtime polymorphism. |
| `Abstraction/` | Hiding implementation details using `abstract` classes and `interfaces`. |
| `Keywords/` | Special keywords: `static` (class-level) and `final` (constants). |
| `Records/` | A modern way to create data-carrying classes (Java 14+). |

## 🚀 How to Run
Navigate to the specific subdirectory and run the Main class.
Example:
```bash
cd ClassesAndObjects
javac Main.java
java Main
```
